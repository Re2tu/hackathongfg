 <p>If you're struggling to meet a fitness goal, it's okay. Instead of beating yourself up, thank your body for all it has helped you accomplish. Then, reassess whether your current goals are realistic for you right now or if they need to be adjusted.

    "Give yourself a 'clean slate policy'," says Treece. "Forgive yourself for the past, and look at today as a new opportunity to get back on track."
    
    This also might be a good time to remind yourself of your "why" that motivated you to tackle this goal in the first place.
    
    "Change isn't easy," Musser says. "But when you are able to pull yourself out of your comfort zone, you've done some truly remarkable work."</p>
